As the 1st Quarter of 9th Grade comes to an end, I would like to share my experiences, struggles, what I learned, and what I am willing to improve for ICT.
<br><br>When I heard about the 1st Quarter being all about HTML coding, it was just a similar recap to what we learned in 8th Grade, with additional information this year. Sometimes, I struggled with coding, as it was confusing, but there are some times where I understood, and I had alot of fun coding, just like this portfolio!
<br><br>Making this portfolio meant that I could do what I want to design, and put the content however I want it to appear, which made me enjoy coding this E-Portfolio. I'd say my written works and performance tasks this quarter were alright, and the periodicals were not too hard, as I finished it easily!
<br><br>Following the next quarter, I want to keep studying and working hard, so I can do better in passing the written works, inputting the correct code in performance tasks, and ace the next periodicals!
<br><br>Lastly, I would like to thank Ms. Uminga for teaching us the basics of coding, and how we can apply it to making our own websites. I am looking forward to coding, as this year goes on and as we learn more! Thank you!
